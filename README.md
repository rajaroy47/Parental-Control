## ✨ Available Commands ✨

BelieveMe utilizes a command-based system for its functionalities. These commands can be triggered through a designated interface within the parent's device (e.g., SMS or a separate companion app).

* **/hide** — Hide the application icon from the app drawer. This makes the app discreet and less likely to be tampered with.
* **/unhide** — Restore the application icon to the app drawer, making it visible again.

### ⚡️ Fun Actions

Engage with the child's device in playful ways (use responsibly!).

* **/torchon** — Turn ON the device's flashlight.
* **/torchoff** — Turn OFF the device's flashlight.
* **/vibrate** — Make the device vibrate.
* **/ring_phone** — Make the device ring loudly for 10 seconds. Useful for locating a misplaced device.
